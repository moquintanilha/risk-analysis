# How Can I Contribute?


You can contribute by:
- :bug: Reporting a bug
- :point_up: Suggesting enhancements

For either contribution we use [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) and specified templates as a guide to describe your issue in a simple and complete way. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestions and solve issues faster or comprehend the requested feature easier.

## :bug: How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for Risk Analysis. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. 
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, screenshots, logs, which you use in those examples. Please use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.
